# MT-TECHNO
 
I tried turtle in python for the first time. 
For my 50th video I decided to make a picture of Technoblade's Minecraft head skin in python.
you can use this code in other programs as I had included two def functions: 

1)paint(lst,cord): 
    In this "lst" is the list of hex codes or colors need for the image and
    cord" is the list of coordinates which can be made by the following function(If the image is a perfect square).

2)cord(y): 
    In this "y" is the y coordinate and x is not nessasary inside the function, since x=y it can be taken the same or
    just leave x as it is and don't forget to define x,y,z,c

In my code: 
x=105; 
y=x; 
z=70; 
c=350;
